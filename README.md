This script will continuously search for items on Craigslist.  When a search returns a hit, it will email new links to me.  Each link is compared to previous search results to ensure that no duplicates are sent.

The script will need to be tweaked from time to time as Craigslist likes to throw off anyone who uses their data.  They do this by changing ever-so-slightly the output.  Since this cript meticulously searches the results to clean up the output, it must match the Craigslist search results exactly for it to work.
